# ScisTreeR
Fast maximum-likelihood phylogeny inference from noisy single-cell data using the 'ScisTree' algorithm [(Wu, Bioinformatics 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/3/742/5555811). 'scistreer' provides an 'R' interface and improves speed via 'Rcpp' and 'RcppParallel', making the method applicable to massive single-cell datasets (>10,000 cells).

# Installation
To install the stable CRAN version, 
```R
install.packages('scistreer', dependencies = TRUE)
```
To get the most recent updates, you can install the github version via `devtools`:
```R
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/kharchenkolab/scistreer')
```
# Usage
Within R, you only need to supply a genotype probability matrix (cell x mutation), where each entry is the probability that the cell harbors the mutation. For example,


```R
treeML = run_scistree(P_example, ncores = 8, init = 'UPGMA', verbose = FALSE)
```
The output maximum likelihood tree is an `ape::phylo` object. You can visualize the output and the probability matrix as follows:
```R
plot_phylo_heatmap(treeML, P_example)
```

# Benchmark
`scistreer` is about 10x faster than the [original implementation](https://github.com/yufengwudcs/ScisTree) on a single thread. The runtime of `scistreer` can be further reduced by shared-memory multi-threading via `RcppParallel`.
